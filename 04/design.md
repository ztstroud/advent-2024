# 04

I see two approaches here, and they both seem fun.

One approach would be to create ways to manipulate the board into strings that
are easy to search. I will need to be able to rotate the board 90 degrees, and
by 45 degrees. At that point, you can use simple in string searches.

Another approach is write tools to search for strings at 0 and 45 degree angles.
I would also need a rotate by 90 degrees tool, but that is simpler than the
rotate by 45 degrees tool.

Because these are both interesting, I want to try both. In that process, I want
to play around with testing two implementations with a single suite of tests.
